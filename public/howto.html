          Plantchi is a multiplayer collaborative plant care game! You can take care of a plant by yourself or with
          friends.
        </li> <br>
        <li>To start, choose a plant type and you will be escorted to where the plant is.</li><br>
        <li>Players can choose which “action” to take to care of their plant. The needs are Hunger, Thirst,
          Entertainment,
          Light.</li><br>
        <li>Different plants have different needs. Some plants are harder to take care of!</li><br>
        <li>If the need bar gets too low, the plant will leave and the game is over. But you can always play again!</li>
