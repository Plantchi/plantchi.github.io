                Plantchi is a multiplayer collaborative plant care game! You can take care of a plant by yourself or with friends.
              </li>
              <li>To start, choose a plant type and you will be escorted to where the plant is.</li>
              <li>Players can choose which “action” to take to care of their plant. The needs are Hunger, Thirst, Entertainment, Light.</li>
              <li>You will see a bar for each need, and if the need level gets kind of low, a warning will display.</li>
              <li>If the need bar gets too low, the plant will leave and the game is over.</li>
